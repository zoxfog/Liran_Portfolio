### Part 2: (in progress)



This part is a follow up to part 1, here we download all the necessary data down to the 1-minute open, close, high, low and volume bars to retrieve better insight and accuracy.
we also address the issues that came up in the previous project and start creating a foundation for algo-trading, for example find preferabe pre-trade attributes for stock picking using agents and start training the data for reinforcement learning.
